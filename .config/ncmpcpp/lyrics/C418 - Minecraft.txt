Beautiful sky of blue in the morning
Flowers that bloom, as they do in the morning
Finding peace when the new day is dawning
Never cease, waiting for the stars adorning
There he goes, no one knows, where he's roaming
But all is well, time will tell, this path unknowing
Over there, see the land of Bountiful
Take it in, oh the sight of it all

Hear the song of the birds in the morning
Sing along to the tune they're performing
The world is right, when the new day is dawning
And in the night, you will find stars falling
Oh, there he goes
No one knows, where he's roaming
But all is well, time will tell
The path unknowing
